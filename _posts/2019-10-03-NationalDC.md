In the Chinese traditions, turning 70-year-old is a big deal. Even A special Chinese word is reserved for those turing 70, 古稀 (Gu Xi, rare in the history). Usually, a family will host a big party for their parents’ 70-year-old birthday. 

In my perspective, this serves as the fundamental background of the National Day celebration this year. Trade war is far from the end, the economy is slowing down, and Hong Kong is still a mess. These may as well be the reasons for the largest scale military parade, but for ordinary residents humming the rhythm of Me and My Country ([我和我的祖国](https://v.qq.com/x/cover/mzc0020036349xa/f0032mfvxjg.html)) on the subway, in the offices, or in the restaurants, the recent publicity efforts from the government made them believe that celebrating the birthday of their motherland is celebrating the the payoff of their own hard work.

# Persons VS People 

For the CCP, 人民 is a often-mentioned word. Most of the times it is translated into the people. In the Chinese context, 人民 represents a massive number of individuals. It highlights the sense of group. However, this year’s celebration is tuned a bit different when talking about 人民. Individuals, rather than the group, are given more weight. Many intentional designs are aiming at letting each ordinary resident find some pieces of their ordinary lives in the official celebration events. One of the parade team marching through the Tiananmen Square is made up by the scooter-riding delivery men (外卖小哥). Given Beijing government’s attempt to limit the number of e-scooters in the past year, this is true surprise. Another parade team is made up by people riding old-style bicycles, called Two-Eight-Model Bike. In the 1980s, these bikes were the most common means of transportation in cities in China. Both my parents burst into laughter when they saw the bike-riding parade team, telling that they rode these bikes everyday when they were my age.

Each 10-year-celebration will witness one or two Theme Movies (主旋律影片), which serves are congratulations to the country. In the past, these movies focuses on the stories of forefathers, such as *The Founding of A Republic* in 2009. This year, the most focused theme movie, *My People, My Country*, tells 7 stories of 7 ordinary persons related to 7 historical event of the republic. For example, the first story is about how an engineer struggled to fix the electric flagpole on the Tiananmen Square the eve before the Founding Ceremony on Oct 1st, 1949. The second is a young girl’s sobbing on his missing boyfriend who was secretly summoned for the China’s nuclear project in 1960s. The third is about how a young boy, the son of a telecommunication technitian, held the TV antenna on the roof so that hundreds of neighbors could see the live of women volleyball team gain the championship in 1985. Judging from my friends’ WeChat posts, these stories are well received.

Another reflection is related to the emphasis on Heroes, especially the aging heroes and the passed-ways. On Sept 29, the country for the fist time hold a grand ceremony presenting Medals of the Republic to 8 senior heroes in the Great Hall of People. Among them are agricultural scientist Mr. Yuan Longping who is famous for the hybrid rice, the medical scientist Mrs. Tu Youyou who got the Nobel Prize for discovering a new method curing Malaria, and the deputy county secretary Mrs. Shen Jilan who advocated for the gender equality in the 1990s. On the early morning of Sept 29, these heroes boarded their vehicles, and were escorted to the Tiananmen Square by the motor-guard-of-honor which are used to welcome the foreign head-of-states.

# Women Volleyball

女排, or Women Volleyball, is not only sport, but a spiritual symbol after Reform and Opening Up. In the early 1980s, the women volleyball team out-played many world-famous teams, including the US, received many championships. It was such a spiritual encouragement for the Chinese at that time that girls in the teams are welcomed as supermodels in today’s sense. My mother recalled that all the neighbors will gather in the yard, and the only TV set in the neighborhood would be relocated to they yard. Due to bad signals, the picture constantly moves on the screen, and people would move their heads along with the picture, like synchonized swimming.  

The Chinese Women Volleyball team is a symbol of never giving up. Even in recent years it has brought many (good) surprises to the Chinese people. In 2004 Olympics final, it lost the first 2 sets to the Russian team, but in the end won the last 3 sets, getting the gold medal home. In the 2016 Olympics, it lost to strong teams such as Brazil and Netherlands during the group stage, and nobody expect the team to win when they encountered the two team again during the knockout game. However, after lengthy struggles, the young girls brought back the gold medal again.

This year the World Championship of women volleyball was scheduled in late September. Nobody expected that girls would brought back the trophy with 11 victories (wining all the games in the round robin). In Chinese, 11 is written as 十一, which is the short version of Oct 1st (十月一日, the date of the National Day).  This coincidence is treated as a bless. As the only team that can deliver victories among the three Big Balls (football, basketball, and volleyball), the girls were invited by President Xi personally to attend the dinner reception on the evening of Sept 30, which were attended by government officials and ambassadors. Xi even met each of them in a conference room before the reception. During the Tiananmen parade on Oct 1st, they were standing on the last festooned vehicle-float, which was the only vehicle-float stayed in from of the Square rather than just passing by.

By the way, the currently chief coach, Mrs. Lang Ping, is a legendary lady. 30 years ago, she was one of the backstone of the women volleyball team getting all these gold medals and trophies. Her forceful smashspike earned a nickname of Iron Hammer. After retiring, she became the chief coach for a short period of time, and then begun her journey coaching foreign club teams. In 2008, the US women volleyball team she led beat China in the quarter final, bringing a silver medal home. She assumed the chief coach of China team in 2013 when the team sliding down the hill.

Do the best of your own job is the best practice of patriosm. This is how people read into the honorary treatment of the women volleyball team.


# Tsinghua and Peking students in the parade

Many of the 170,000 Beijingers participating the parade are university students. Both Tsinghua and Peking have their own parade team. 10 years ago, both university asked freshmen student who just participated the orientation military training to participate the team (in a sense, forced them). This year all the students are voluntary sign-ups. However, even for Tsinghua, a university with the Red tradition, it is hard to to attract 3500  students for the parade at one time. To draw students’ attention, each university put forward a list of coupons. Tsinghua waived the 5-credit social field research requirement for all students participating. Peking made special-edition student ID card and special canteen cuisines for participants They went through a 2 week closed-set training during the summer vacation, special trainings during weekends after school was in session, and three mid-night Tiananmen Square rehearsals in September.

Students from both universities have something to feel proud of. Peking students get to yell the slogan 团结起来，振兴中华 (unite together to revive the motherland) when they march across the Square, which was the slogan the PKU students drafted in 1981 when the man volleyball team won the game guaranteeing a ticket to the World Cup, which became a famous slogan adopted by many other university students. However, comparing to Peking student surrounding a torch-vehiclefloat, Tsinghua students are much more excited that they surrounded the vehiclefloat carrying President Xi’s oil portrait. They joke that they were protecting their 学长 (senior classmate).

Assigning Tsinghua students, rather than their Peking mates,  such a politically important task is no coincidence. Earlier this year, Peking University experienced a severe political turmoil. A group of students transformed the Peking University Marxism Club into a battle field for Marxian Fundamentalism. They blame the Reform and Opening Up as surrender to Capitalism, and helped organized a worker-strike in Shenzhen. It was an explosive piece of news to the CCP leadership. Partly due to the incident, initially Peking students were not assigned an individual parade team as Tsinghua. Rather, they were to be grouped with students from other universities. This is regarded as a slap in the face (especially to the University leadership). After lengthy discussion, Peking students were granted with an individual parade team. These are a piece of *rumor* that I heard from Peking students. Not sure if that’s true, but sounds resonalble.
